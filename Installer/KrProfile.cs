///    states outright that it "is not a setup program for a brand new PC". So
///    three pieces have to be made by hand, and each one fails differently when
///    it is missing:
///
///      installedPlugins + devPlugins   -> updater spawns error windows forever
///      dalamudConfig.json              -> same

///                                         never starts inside the game
